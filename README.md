Fixing HTML Stuff: When you're making a navigation menu, slap a <nav> tag on it. If something's clickable, like a button, just use a <button> tag. And for those headings, go wild with <h1> to <h6> tags, depending on how important they are.

Sort Out Colors: Make sure your text and background colors aren't fighting. They should be easy to read.

Add Quick Jump Links: To help folks get around faster, you can add these 'skip links' that pop up at the top when someone's navigating with their keyboard. Super handy!

Jazz Up Interactive Bits: If you've got interactive stuff like buttons, give them a little boost with ARIA roles and attributes. Makes them more accessible. Remember, informality is great for conversation, but when it comes to actual coding, sticking to the proper tags and practices is important for accessibility and compatibility across browsers and devices.
